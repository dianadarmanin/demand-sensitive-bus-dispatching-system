he aim of this study is to investigate whether a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm can help alleviate the problem of the bus bunching phenomenon using various control strategies. In order to achieve such a goal, the following objectives have been identified: • Objective 1 (O1): Simulate the bus bunching phenomenon by arranging for buses to follow a route along a ring-road with varying passenger demand using traffic simulation software (No Control) • Objective 2 (O2): Implement Rule-Based Strategies on the same simulation and measure their effect(Rule-Based Control) • Objective 3 (O3): Apply RL Techniques in order to dynamically control the bus sys- tem • Objective 4 (O4): Assess the performance of the agent and compare it with the re- sults obtained with No Control and Rule-Based Control using performance metrics with respect to headways and waiting times.
